willtheytow.me
==============

**Will they tow me?** aims to help citizens get their cars off of snow emergency routes and out of the way during bad winter weather. We started by using tiles provided by coUrbanize using data from the City of Boston and the City of Cambridge.

# Get this
To start working on this app, you'll want to create your own fork and work from there. If you are signed into github.com you can just click the "Fork" button at the top right corner. Go ahead. It won't hurt.

To actually get the files onto your computer, you'll need to clone the project from your fork to your computer. The following terminal command will create a folder for this project.

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/willtheytow.me`

After which, from inside the project directory (`cd willtheytowme`) you'll have to tell Github to connect your fork to the main repository at Code for Boston! You can do that with this:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/codeforboston/willtheytow.me.git`

Now you're more or less set, just don't forget to make sure you're working with the latest version of Code for Boston's code. To do that, first `git fetch upstream` and then `git merge upstream master` to get the latest changes and merge them into your own working directory (it shouldn't interfere with your own changes).

## That's it?

You won't need to install anything else to make *Will they tow me?* work, just open the index.html in your favorite reasonably modern browser and see.
